# The spatial landscape of gene expression isoforms in tissue sections


In situ capturing technologies add tissue context to gene expression data, with the potential of providing a greater understanding of complex biological systems. However, exploration of alternative splicing and full-length sequence heterogeneity is not detected through current methods, which hinders insights into the full biological complexity. Here, we introduce Spatial Isoform Transcriptomics (SiT), a method for spatial isoform and sequence heterogeneity investigation in tissue sections.
